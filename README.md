# Customer Segmentation Analysis
Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📌 Project Overview
A customer segmentation analysis using K-Means clustering to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to help businesses understand distinct customer profiles for targeted marketing strategies.

🔍 Key Features & Workflow
📊 Data Preprocessing
Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas.
Handled missing values and standardized features for clustering.

📈 Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters
Generated an Elbow plot to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Used within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) to evaluate performance.

🧮 K-Means Clustering
Applied K-Means algorithm from Scikit-learn to segment customers.
Created customer group labels and appended them to the dataset.

📐 Statistical Summary
Calculated the mean statistics for each cluster to understand behavior and characteristics.

📉 2D Visualization of Clusters
Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create a scatter plot of the customer groups.
Visualized clear separation between clusters based on key features.
